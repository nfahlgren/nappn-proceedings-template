NAPPN Abstract Submission Instructions


To be considered for a Lightning talk (also called Fast-Forward Talk) for the 2023 NAPPN meeting, the submission of an abstract no longer than 250 words is required before October 3rd, 2022, but is not required at registration. All live Fast-Forward talks will be in-person so you must plan to attend the meeting in person if you wish to give a live Fast-Forward talk. Abstracts will be published as a collection on ESSOAR/Authorea (https://www.authorea.com/inst/26179). The required template for NAPPN Abstracts is here: https://github.com/nfahlgren/nappn-proceedings-template.

FAQ


* There have been questions in previous years about submitting previously submitted work. In this case we recommend submitting an Abstract of the work (see abstract instructions) and citing the previously submitted work in the abstract. This way there are not repeated DOIs for the same papers.
* Full Talks - Full talks will be selected from conference papers and abstracts. Some priority will be given to conference paper submissions. 
* Live Fast Forward Talks -  Fast Forward talks will be selected from abstracts and conference papers. 
* Virtual Fast Forward Talks- Live Talks and Live Fast Forward Talks will be selected from Abstracts. If you plan to attend the meeting Virtually or are not selected for a live Fast-Forward talk we will have the option of pre-recording a Fast Forward talk that would be available as bonus material on Whova and the NAPPN youtube channel. 
* Posters- If you want to have a poster at the NAPPN meeting please minimally submit an abstract and make sure you indicate you are planning to bring a poster when you register for the meeting.
