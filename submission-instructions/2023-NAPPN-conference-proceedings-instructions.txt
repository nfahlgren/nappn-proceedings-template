NAPPN Conference Proceedings


The NAPPN and the NAPPN Annual Conference Program Committees are excited for the second year of conference proceedings for the 2023 NAPPN Annual meeting. To be considered for a talk for the 2023 NAPPN meeting, the submission of a conference proceeding is required before October 3rd, 2022, but is not required at registration. Papers should be no longer than 4 pages without references. For the hybrid NAPPN Annual Conference all  live talks will be in-person. The conference proceedings will be reviewed and published as a collection on ESSOAR/Authorea (https://www.authorea.com/inst/26178) as a reviewed proceeding paper. The required template for NAPPN Conference Papers is here: https://github.com/nfahlgren/nappn-proceedings-template.

FAQ


* There have been questions in previous years about submitting previously submitted work. In this case we recommend submitting an Abstract of the work (see abstract instructions) and citing the previously submitted work in the abstract. This way there are not repeated DOIs for the same papers.
* Full Talks - Full talks will be selected from conference papers and abstracts. Some priority will be given to conference paper submissions. 
* Live Fast Forward Talks -  Fast Forward talks will be selected from abstracts and conference papers. 
* Virtual Fast Forward Talks- Live Talks and Live Fast Forward Talks will be selected from Abstracts. If you plan to attend the meeting Virtually or are not selected for a live Fast-Forward talk we will have the option of pre-recording a Fast Forward talk that would be available as bonus material on Whova and the NAPPN youtube channel. 
* Posters- If you want to have a poster at the NAPPN meeting please make sure you indicate you are planning to bring a poster when you register for the meeting.
